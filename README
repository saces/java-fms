This project is forked from here: http://gitorious.org/java-fms

Build it by just typing 'ant'

Prepare the node:
 create a dir, for example <node-dir>/fms-libs
 add it to the java path in wrapper.conf: wrapper.java.classpath.3=fms-libs/*.jar

copy from <projectdir>/lib to the dir created in the step above:
 derby.jar, derbyrun.jar, xstream.jar

restart the node.

Load the plugin. Have fun.
